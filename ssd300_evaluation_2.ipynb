    "# SSD Evaluation Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a brief tutorial that explains how compute the average precisions for any trained SSD model using the `Evaluator` class. The `Evaluator` computes the average precisions according to the Pascal VOC pre-2010 or post-2010 detection evaluation algorithms. You can find details about these computation methods [here](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/htmldoc/devkit_doc.html#sec:ap).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example we'll evaluate an SSD300 on the Pascal VOC 2007 `test` dataset, but note that the `Evaluator` works for any SSD model and any dataset that is compatible with the `DataGenerator`. If you would like to run the evaluation on a different model and/or dataset, the procedure is analogous to what is shown below, you just have to build the appropriate model and load the relevant dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: I that in case you would like to evaluate a model on MS COCO, I would recommend to follow the [MS COCO evaluation notebook](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras/blob/master/ssd300_evaluation_COCO.ipynb) instead, because it can produce the results format required by the MS COCO evaluation server and uses the official MS COCO evaluation code, which computes the mAP slightly differently from the Pascal VOC method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In case you want to evaluate any of the provided trained models, make sure that you build the respective model with the correct set of scaling factors to reproduce the official results. The models that were trained on MS COCO and fine-tuned on Pascal VOC require the MS COCO scaling factors, not the Pascal VOC scaling factors."
